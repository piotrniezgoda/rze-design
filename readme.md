# RzeDesign website
RzeDesign website was a part of my bachelor. RzeDesign is an initiative which was started in 2019. The main target of this initiative is promotion good and useful design - design thinking.
You can the live version [HERE](https://rzedesign.netlify.app/).

## Tech stack
I've used:
- Vanilla JS + a little bit jQuery
- Webpack
- Lazyload
- Babel

## Main assumptions
The website was supposed to be simple, clean and fast, responsive(mobile first) and disabled users friendly. I didn't use any framework because I didn't see such a need.
